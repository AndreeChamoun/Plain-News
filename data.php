        adding that he was pretty sure he asked each and every one of the teenagers to confirm that they were legal adults before luring them to his home and forcing them to perform sex acts on him and his friends.
        “They were probably wearing makeup that made them appear to be older 20-year-old sex slaves instead of the actual 13- and 14-year-olds I was molesting and raping. Had I known, I would have told them to go right back to wherever it was I smuggled them from and tricked some adult women into my horrific sex-trafficking ring.
        I guess in some ways, you could say that I’m the real victim here.” ",

        “This kid thinks she deserves that kind of reward just for doing her stupid, easy job? Give me a break,” said a regular Burger King customer who spoke on condition of anonymity and watched with barely concealed disdain as the “privileged and entitled freeloader” worked a 10-hour shift, which included mopping excreta-coated bathrooms,
        suffering prolonged verbal abuse at the counter, wiping tables strewn with wadded-up dirty napkins and ketchup spills, breathing a mist of aerosolized fryer grease and stale sweat for prolonged periods while stationed at the grill, calling an ambulance for an unconscious homeless man in the parking lot, taking overstuffed bags of dripping trash to the dumpster three times an hour,
        and pausing on an overturned pickle bucket in the supply closet for a five-minute break. ",

        “Hey, kid, how’d you like a lifetime appointment on the Ninth Circuit, huh?” asked McConnell, interrupting the 19-year-old temp worker’s protests that he didn’t know anything about the law to tell him that all he needed was “wipe that dumb look off your face” and he could be delivering rulings by the end of the week.
        “You over 18? You got an ID? That’ll do. Now just hop in this car with me and we’ll head over to the Capitol right now. Remember, abortion’s bad, corporations are good, and as for everything else, you just shut the fuck up and do as your told. Got it?” At press time, after the valet nervously informed McConnell that he was hungover and had illegal drugs in his system, the laughing Senate leader assured him that wouldn’t be an issue. ",

One more time, please?” said a visibly gleeful Trump, who according to sources became sullen, pounded on his desk, and threw a paperweight at acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney when the adviser gently suggested it was time to move on to other items on the president’s daily agenda.
        “I’m not going to any stupid meetings. I want to watch my show again. I love it, I love it, I love it! Fast-forward to the part with the big boom!” At press time, reports confirmed Trump was demanding that Pentagon officials make more videos of people dying for him to watch.",

        adding that the team spent years building an apparatus that would allow appendage movement while also keeping the marionette strings from getting tangled. “Just a few months ago, this man couldn’t even lift one hand, but now, he can dangle from the ceiling while his entire body moves back and forth.",

If not,
        we might have to slow down Mark 1:15, change the pitch of His booming voice a bit, and add some flanger and chorus. But He’ll still know we did it. He always knows.” At press time, a representative for the Supreme Being had informed West that God is very busy. ",

        “I don’t understand why a high school kid like her isn’t locking herself in her bedroom and writing bad poetry about how nothing matters and everything is meaningless. Instead of going around the world and giving speeches in which she urges people to save the planet, shouldn’t she be commiserating with her friends about how pointless life is and how we’d all be better off dead? I just don’t get it.” At press time, an online survey found that a majority of Americans agree someone should make sure Thunberg’s parents are aware of her unusual behavior in case she needs to seek help.",

        “If there’s anything that the rise of Silicon Valley has taught us, it’s that in order to make trailblazing breakthroughs in cruelty and technological oppression, we need to empower the private sector,” said Zuckerberg, adding that without the promise of being able to fund and ultimately make money off of his inventions,
        he would have never worked to erode civil liberties, invade people’s privacy on a grand scale, and manipulate the democratic process by creating Facebook. “If we want the kind of brutal, intrusive solutions that the market can provide, we can’t punish those who have risen to the top based on their genius at perpetuating human suffering.

Well, I guess we’ll just call this the first-ever manned mission to explore this planet’s core,”
        said sweat-covered and visibly panicked NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine, who paused momentarily to put up a crudely drawn diagram labeled “Core Shot 2020” depicting the rocket burrowing through the planet’s crust towards its 10,000-degree-Fahrenheit inner core. “Thanks to the ship’s powerful boosters and its pointed tip, we anticipate the rocket might conceivably break through the Earth’s mantle and reach its destination within the year.
        I also cannot stress enough the bravery of the two astronauts inside the rocket, who are presumably okay with all of this. You know, some might even say a NASA expedition to the Earth’s core was long overdue.” At press time, NASA officials expressed hope that the rocket would exit the other side of the Earth and proceed on its previously planned mission to restock the International Space Station by 2021.
